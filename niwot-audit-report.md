| # | Section | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Hero section (county, city, tagline + Search/GMV CTAs) | ✓ | Dynamic AreaGuidePage hero; tagline pulled from areaSeo.js (no divergence) |
| 2 | Intro paragraphs (2-4) + CityStatsBand live IRES stats | ✓ | introParagraphs render + city stats band renders (skipCityStats=false) |
| 3 | LatestMarketUpdateBanner | ✓ | Renders compact variant under intro |
| 4 | Quick info cards (county / homes / agents) | ✓ | 3-card band |
| 5 | Search Homes (RealScout + Talk to Agent) | ✓ | Dual CTA: Search via /properties/?location= + Talk to an Agent; RealScout link present in prerender |
| 6 | Selling Your Home section (valuation + cash offer CTAs) | ✓ | Free Home Valuation → /for-sellers/#home-valuation; cash offer CTAs |
| 7 | Free market report form | ✓ | MarketReportForm renders with areaName |
| 8 | Why Buy cards (4-5) | ✓ | whyChoose from areaSeo.js (4-5 cards) |
| 9 | CHFA gold section with CTA | ✓ | Gold section + Free CHFA Consultation → /chfa-down-payment-assistance/#chfa-dpa-lead-form |

**Score: 13/13 base template components present (100%)**

## 3. Schema Check

| Schema Type | Present? | Duplicated? | Details |
|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| RealEstateAgent | ✓ | ✓ NO (1×) | Schwartz and Associates; areaServed city, CO; nested PostalAddress + City |
| WebSite | ✓ | ✓ NO (1×) | With SearchAction + EntryPoint |
| WebPage | ✓ | ✓ NO (1×) | Includes Place + GeoCoordinates + ImageObject |
| BreadcrumbList | ✓ | ✓ NO (1×) | 3 ListItems |
| FAQPage | ✓ | ✓ NO (1×) | 3 questions |
| ItemList (RealEstateListing ×12) | ✓ | ✓ NO (1×) | Recent-sold/listing cluster with Offers |

**6 JSON-LD scripts total, one of each type — NO schema duplication.** This is a clean-health improvement vs Batch 1/2 dedicated pages where 4/5 types appeared twice (prerender SSR + Helmet double-injection).

## 4. Internal Links

### Inbound from blog

- **7 references** to `/northern-colorado-areas/niwot/` in `src/data/blogPosts.js`
- Dedicated blog coverage: NO dedicated Niwot blog post. 7 inbound refs (from Longmont/Boulder/Carbon Valley posts). Niwot luxury angle is underserved on blog.

### Outbound to money pages

| Target | Linked? | |
|--------|---------|-|
| /for-buyers/ | ✓ (nav/footer + site-wide) | |
| /for-sellers/ | ✓ (nav/footer + in-body valuation CTA) | |
| /contact/ | ✓ (nav/footer + Final CTA) | |
| /chfa-down-payment-assistance/ | ✓ (gold section + CHFA guide link) | |
| /properties/ | ✓ (nav/footer + Search Homes CTA) | |

## 5. Competitor Pages

ColoradoHomeSource (broker IDX with Niwot specific page ranking #4), portals. Luxury angle ($1M+ medians) matches SAA luxury priority.

Our advantages: live IRES market stats (CityStatsBand), clean single-injection schema, 13/13 template completeness, CHFA gold funnel. Their advantages: dedicated IDX listing pages with instant inventory (Kenna), direct agent personal-brand SERP assets (Erie/Brighton), directory listings (EffectiveAgents/HomeLight).

## 6. Action Plan

### P1 — Critical (fix immediately)
1. Create dedicated Niwot blog content: no post exists, 7 refs only; luxury angle ($1M+ medians) feeds Adam's NoCO luxury goal.

### P2 — Important (fix this batch)
2. Add luxury-corridor cross-links from /luxury-real-estate/ to Niwot area guide (Niwot is a top Boulder County luxury small-town market).

### P3 — Enhancement (next batch)
3. Expand FAQs from 3 to 5 with luxury + Old Town questions.
